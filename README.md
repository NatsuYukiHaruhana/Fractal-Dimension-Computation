<h1 align="center">Fractal Dimension Computation</h1>
<h2 align="center">🔎About🔎</h2>
<p>This work presents a framework for testing the runtime and results of fractal dimension computation algorithms. Included is temporarily one such algorithm by Juan Ruiz de Miras and Miguel Ángel Posadas, found <a href="[natsuyukiharuhana@gmail.com](https://www.ugr.es/~demiras/fbc/)" target="_blank">here</a>, as well as a Jupyter Notebook file through which you can generate input data and run the built executables of the algorithms.</p>
